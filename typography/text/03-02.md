## Mathematics

Jekyll uses MathJax, which displays MathML. The Electric Book workflow does not yet support MathJax output in print output, but you can find out more at [github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow/issues/26](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow/issues/26) if you want to implement it in the meantime.

First, LaTeX-style maths:

$$E = mc^2$$

And then MathML:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
	<mrow>
	<mi>a</mi>
	<mo>+</mo>
	<mi>b</mi>
	</mrow>
</math>
