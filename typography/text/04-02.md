## Video

The Electric Book template includes an include tag for easily inserting YouTube videos. (Other services may be supported in future.) The Electric Book guide provides more detail on how that's done. Here's a video.

{% include youtube id="MqlyxZiDoOA" %}

In epub output, authors may choose to replace it with a link to watch the video online. Video iframes won't validate in EPUB2.

Our default iframe code gives the iframe a `.non-printing` class, so that themes can hide videos from the PDF editions. We may change this in future.
