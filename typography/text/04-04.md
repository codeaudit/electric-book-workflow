## Quizzes

You can embed any online quiz in a book. We like to use our own quiz engine, [Betterquiz](https://github.com/electricbookworks/betterquiz). Here's a quiz from a nursing textbook. How well do you know your Ebola prevention?

In print, you may want to use a Liquid logic tag to display a fallback link to the online quiz.
